# Python Indentation
# Understand the importance of indentation in Python as a way to make certain
# lines of code subsidiaries of other lines of code.
# e.g.
# if 5 > 2: #This is a parent line of code
#    print("yes") #this is a child line of code

# Comparator Operators
# > Greater than
# < Less than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# <= Less than or equal to
# == Equal to
# != Not equal to

# = means Assignment and  == means checking equality
